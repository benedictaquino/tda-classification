# [Topological Classification](http://benedictaquino.com/tda-numbers)

I want to replicate the methods used in the paper [The Ring of Algebraic Functions on Persistence Bar Codes](http://intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/hha/2016/0018/0001/HHA-2016-0018-0001-a021.pdf) published by Adcock et al. Seems like some real neato stuff.

As an exercise, I want to implement concepts from algebraic topology concerning abstract simplicial complexes in (mostly) base Python.
