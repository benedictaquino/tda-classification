# [Topological Classification](http://benedictaquino.com/tda-classification)

I want to replicate the methods used in the paper [The Ring of Algebraic Functions on Persistence Bar Codes](http://intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/hha/2016/0018/0001/HHA-2016-0018-0001-a021.pdf) published by Adcock et al. Seems like some real neato stuff.

As an exercise, I want to implement concepts from algebraic topology concerning abstract simplicial complexes in (mostly) base Python rather than use an existing package like Dionysus[https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/] as I have previously for computing homologies. Once I have all the functionality I want, I'll begin porting computationally expensive portions to C++. Hopefully this project keeps me busy and makes me feel fulfilled or whatever.
